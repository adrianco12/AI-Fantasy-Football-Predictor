# NFL Fantasy Performance Predictor

## Project Overview
A neural network predicts NFL players’ future fantasy performance using historical statistics. The model captures complex factors like usage trends, injuries, and team context to provide accurate projections and improve fantasy draft decisions.

## Problem Statement
Fantasy football decisions rely on accurate player projections, which are influenced by many interacting factors. Traditional linear models often fail to capture these nonlinear relationships. This project uses a fully connected neural network for regression to predict next-season performance based on past data.

## Features
- Uses historical player statistics as input
- Accounts for nonlinear interactions between factors
- Regression-based prediction for precise fantasy point estimates
- Generalizes across thousands of player seasons

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
